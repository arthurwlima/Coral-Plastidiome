# Coral-Plastidiome

Repository containing the scripts and results from the compilation and re-evaluation of published resultd of culture-independent coral microbiome studies.

Results from this study are currently under review at PeerJ:
Pires CP, Villela LB, Moura RL, Salomon PS, Silva-Lima AW. Hidden microalgae diversity in reef systems: exploring plastid communities in Southwestern Atlantic Ocean coral microbiomes

Taxonomic assignment of microalgae plastid 16S gene sequences fortuitously observed in coral-microbiome studies is based on consensus-blastn searches against the phytoRef/PR2 database, version 4.12 (Decelle et al 2015).
